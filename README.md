## Introduction of Jupyter ,numpy and matplotlib


Jupyter[http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html](The Jupyter Notebook App is a server-client application that allows editing and running notebook documents via a web browser. The Jupyter Notebook App can be executed on a local desktop requiring no internet access (as described in this document) or can be installed on a remote server and accessed through the internet.)
numpy[http://www.numpy.org/] (Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.)
matplotlib [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib](is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.[2] SciPy makes use of matplotlib.)
